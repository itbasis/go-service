== Naming policy


. Use underscore as separator in table and field names

. Indexes are written with a separator through a hyphen. `table_name-field_name-key`, where `key` - index name suffix
.. Primary Key indexes have a `pkey` suffix
.. Unique indexes have a `udx` suffix
.. Reference indexes are suffixed with `fk`
.. All other indexes have the `idx` suffix

. For financial values, we use the `decimal` type with an indication of the dimension and precision
